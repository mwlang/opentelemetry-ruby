    # The Adapter class holds all metadata and configuration for an
    # instrumentation adapter. All instrumentation adapter packages should
    # include a subclass of +Instrumentation::Adapter+ that will register
    # it with +OpenTelemetry.instrumentation_registry+ and make it available for
    # discovery and installation by an SDK.
    #
    # A typical subclass of Adapter will provide an install block, a present
    # block, and possibly a compatible block. Below is an
    # example:
    #
    # module OpenTelemetry
    #   module Adapters
    #     module Sinatra
    #       class Adapter < OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Adapter
    #         install do |config|
    #           # install instrumentation, either by library hook or applying
    #           # a monkey patch
    #         end
    #
    #         # determine if the target library is present
    #         present do
    #           defined?(::Sinatra)
    #         end
    #
    #         # if the target library is present, is it compatible?
    #         compatible do
    #           Gem.loaded_specs['sinatra'].version > MIN_VERSION
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # The adapter name and version will be inferred from the namespace of the
    # class. In this example, they'd be 'OpenTelemetry::Adapters::Sinatra' and
    # OpenTelemetry::Adapters::Sinatra::VERSION, but can be explicitly set using
    # the +adapter_name+ and +adapter_version+ methods if necessary.
    #
    # All subclasses of OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Adapter are automatically
    # registered with OpenTelemetry.instrumentation_registry which is used by
    # SDKs for instrumentation discovery and installation.
    #
    # Instrumentation libraries can use the adapter subclass to easily gain
    # a reference to its named tracer. For example:
    #
    # OpenTelemetry::Adapters::Sinatra.instance.tracer
    #
    # The adapter class establishes a convention for disabling an adapter
    # by environment variable and local configuration. An adapter disabled
    # by environment variable will take precedence over local config. The
    # convention for environment variable name is the library name, upcased with
    # '::' replaced by underscores, and '_ENABLED' appended. For example:
    # OTEL_RUBY_INSTRUMENTATION_SINATRA_ENABLED = false.
